To generate an initial configuration of the polyethylene oxide system, follow the instructions as follows:

- Type in the terminal: python makeinitiallammps.py peoxide.in
  We will get an initial template of a Lammps input specifically for the polymer chains, that is to say, positions and velocities with a value equal to zero for 37 chains of 273 atomistic monomers, bonds, angles and dihedrals.

- Type in the terminal: python peoxide.py traj.lammpstrj
  We will get a trayectory file of an initial configuration of linear polymeric chains inside a box with the correct density. The parameters to create the chains inside the box are the angles between C and O atoms. Obviously, we can change some parameters in the peoxide.py script in order to change the caracteristic of the system like angles, bonds, number of monomers, number of chains, etc.

- Type in the terminal: python dump2conf.py peoxide.in traj.lammpstrj peoxide.in
  This is to overwrite the input Lammps file with the atoms positions we got with the previous script

- We can check the correct angles and bonds with the vmd software.
  Open the trayectory file with vmd (vmd traj.lammpstrj)
  In the vmd menu select the Mouse option and then select label. Here we will have the options bonds and angles, we can select one of them and then select some atoms to corroborate the distances and angles.

- The file peoxide.in can be used as an input configuration for a simulation in Lammps
